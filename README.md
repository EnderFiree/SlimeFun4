Looking for the download link? Click here

Slimefun is a plugin which aims to turn your Spigot Server into a modpack without ever installing a single mod. It offers everything you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks! Slimefun lets every player decide on their own how much they want to dive into Magic or Tech.
We got everything from magical wands to nuclear reactors.
We feature a magical altar, an electric power grid and even item transport systems.

This project originally started back in 2013 and has grown ever since.
From one single person working on this plugin back then, we grew to a community of thousands of players and hundreds of contributors to this project.
It currently adds over 500 new items and recipes to Minecraft (Read more about the history of this project).

But it also comes with a lot of addons! Check out our addons, you may find exactly what you were looking for.
